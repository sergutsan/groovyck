\section{Version control}
\label{sec:version-control}

What is version control? It is something as simple (and as difficult
to make right) as keeping track of changes in some piece of work, over
time. You
are probably familar with some very rudimentary version of version
control. Have you ever listed the documents in a folder and seen
something similar to this?

\begin{itemize}
\item myDocument
\item myDocument-2
\item myDocument-3
\item myDocument-final
\item myDocument-final2
\item myDocument-final-final
\item myDocument-definitive
\item myDocument-defitive-USE-THIS-ONE
\end{itemize}

If so, you already understand the most important idea behind version
control: our work is never created in one go, it changes over time and
sometimes we want to make sure we can go back in time to a former
version of it\ldots just in case. 

Many modern programs have version control embedded into them,
e.g. word processors like Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Write, or Google
Docs (also known as Google Drive). Very often they just track the
changes made to the document, sometimes they allow the user to go back
and forth in time to review, accept, or discard changes. This is also
very common in wiki sites like the Wikipedia. 

% TODO: add a screenshot of the version control in wikipedia here. 

Version control systems were initially created to track changes in
\emph{source code}. They were created by programmers for
programmers. We have come a long way since those days, and now version
control is spread over many different applications, but they still
pursue the same two goals: 

\begin{description}
\item[Reversibility: ] the capacity of going back in time if you mess
  up and introduce bugs in your code (sorry, I meant \emph{when} you
  introduce bugs in your code).
\item[Concurrency: ] the capacity of working together with other
  people on the same project, on the same file, at the same time. 
\end{description}

These two capacities are basic for any modern programmer, and that is
why version control is (or should be) part of every programmer's daily
life. Modern programs are big and complex, and several programmers
work on them. Without appropriate version control, they cannot work at
the same time: they need to take turns, pass the baton\ldots this is
really unproductive, good programmers do not work like
that. Additionally, programmers ---even good programmers, as long as
they are human--- make mistakes all the time, sometimes serious
mistakes that break their programs completely, and they need to go
back in time to the point where everything was working fine and start
again (in large and complicated programs, this may mean a long time).

In this chapter we will learn to make version control on your source
code files \emph{right}, not as shown above (e.g. myProgramOLD.jdc,
etc). We will use a program for doing so called \emph{Git}.

\section{Git}
\label{sec:git}

There are many programs for performing source code version control
nowadays. For this course, we are using Git, a version control system
created by Linus Torvalds, the same guy that created Linux. It is not
difficult to use but it is very powerful. 

Other very common version control systems are Subversion (also known
as svn) and Mercurial. There are many more. There are many sources
online, starting with Wikipedia, that will tell you the history of
version control, the differences between different systems, and much
more. I encourage you to go and read about it if you think the topic
is fascinating. If you just want to learn to use Git normally in
your life as a programmer, this section will help you learn the
basics. 

As you can imagine, a full book could be written about all the
possibilities and options that come with Git ---actually, several ones
have been published already. In this section I will just present the
most important 10\% of Git, which is all 
you will need 90\% of the time.  

\subsection{Starting a new project}
\label{sec:starting-new-project}

Let's start by creating a new programming project. There are two ways
of doing this, locally and using an online repository manager. As the
latter is simpler from the point of view of sharing your code (more on
that later), we will explain that option here. 

We will use GitHub (www.github.com), 
one of the most well-knowned online repository
managers\footnote{There are many others: BitBucket, Google Code\ldots
  the list is endless.}. 
It is also costless to use, which is a big plus. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/gitHubScreenshot.eps}
  \caption{Screenshot of GitHub. You can see the name of the user
    (``bbk-msccs''), the name of the repository
    (``currency-exchanger''), and the URL. 
    % You can use the URL both to
    % clone the reposity and to push your changes (as long as this
    % repository is yours, i.e. you can \emph{write} on it).
    }
  \label{fig:github}
\end{figure}

Creating an account on GitHub is easy and free. Click on the ``Create
a repo'' button, choose a name and a description, and you are ready to
go. It could not be easier. 

Now that you now how to create repositories, we will learn how use
them to keep track of the evolution of your source code. For the
purposes of the following discussion, I will assume that you have an
account at GitHub and that your account name is ``ilovegit''.  In some
cases I will need a sample repository to explain some of the features;
unless the text says otherwise, I will assume that you have created a
repository in GitHub called ``my-currency-exchange'' and the examples
will refer to this repository created by ``ilovegit''.

% REMOVED - FOR EXTRA INFO

% Create a new folder
% where you will put your programs. Now we want to start keeping track
% of all changes. Assuming Git is installed in your system, and that you
% are on the right folder, you only need to type \verb+git init+. With
% this simple command, you have told Git to \emph{be ready} to keep 
% track of whatever happens in this folder. So the full initialisation
% of a complex complete version control system with Git looks like this: 

% \begin{verbatim}
%     > mkdir MyProject
%     > cd MyProject
%     > git init
% \end{verbatim}

% That was easy, wasn't it? Now you can keep track of all changes to
% your files in this folder. Moving on\ldots

% \subsection{Name and email address}
% \label{sec:name-email-address}

% Every time somebody makes a change to a program, Git marks the change
% with the name and the email address of the person responsible for it. 
% As you do not want to do is writing your
% name and your email address every time you make a change, this is
% usually set up at the beginning. You can do it with the command 
% \verb+git config+. 

% \begin{verbatim}
%     > git config --global user.name "John Smith"
%     > git config --global user.email "john.smith@student-bbk-ac-uk"
%     > git config --global user.email "john.smith@gmail"
% \end{verbatim}

% These commands will set your name and email address for every (local)
% repository in your machine because you are using the \verb+--global+
% flag. 
% %
% Without the \verb+--global+ flag, 
% the command modifies the configuration of
% the current repository only. 
% Sometimes you want to have different names or
% emails on different repositories, although this is rare. 

% Note that the email address does not need to be valid. To avoid spam,
% it is not uncommon for users to use email addresses that are perfectly
% understandable for human beings but confusing for spambots, 
% e.g. removing the last \verb+.com+ (john.smith@gmail)
% or changing dots for dashes (john.smith@student-bbk-ac-uk).

\subsection{Think global, act local}
\label{sec:cloning-technology}

A repository is just a place (somewhere on the internet or in a
private intranet) where the source code for a software project is
stored. There are two types of repositories for any project:
\emph{local copies}, where you do the work; and \emph{one public
  copy}, that other people can look at.  Any machine on the internet
can be used to host a public copy of a Git project and GitHub
(\verb+www.github.com+) is a convenient place that many people use.

You cannot write your programs on GitHub, you can only do it in your
local copy. Therefore, the first thing you have to do after creating
your repository on GitHub is making a local copy, a process known as
\emph{cloning}. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git clone https://github.com/bbk-myName/my-repository.git
\end{verbatim}

This will create a local copy of the remote repository you have just
created. You can now make changes to it: create new files, modify the
existing ones, etc.

(You can also clone repositories that were created long time ago and/or
by other people. More on that later.) 

\subsection{Keeping track of changes}
\label{sec:keep-track-chang}

Let's start by writing some code. For example, let's create a
simple \emph{Hello World} application in Groovy\footnote{Feel free to
  use Java Decaf or Java instead of Groovy for the following
  examples.}. In other words, we 
will edit a file called \verb+helloworld.groovy+ and write on it:

\begin{verbatim}
    print "Hello World!"
\end{verbatim}

If we execute this little program, it will print the words ``Hello
World!'' on the screen. So far, so good. Time to start filling up our
\emph{version journal}! 

The first step is to tell Git that we want to keep track of this
file. In other words, we \emph{add} it to the list of files under
Git's responsibility. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git add helloworld.groovy
\end{verbatim}

And now we must perform the most important operation in any version control
system: \emph{committing} our changes. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git commit
\end{verbatim}

You will be asked to introduce some description of what this \emph{commit}
is about. Git automatically adds information about which files are
committed and what changes have been performed on them. The programmer
must provide some additional information: a short message to explain
to other programmers what the changes are about. Note that ``other
programmers'' can mean yourself in two weeks time ---when you have
forgotten what you committed at this point. Typical messages are
``First commit'', ``Fixed bug \#1304'', ``Added a new feature
for\ldots''; examples of bad non-informative commit messages are ``new
commit'', ``More code'', or ``Fixed it AT LAST!'' (what is
\emph{it}?). Write whatever you 
want, but make a (small) effort to think what message will be useful
for people reading it in the future.

When you finish writing your commit description, save it and close the
editor. The commit will be performed, and you will be given some
output from Git. That output will include information about the
branch (by default, it is called \emph{master}), the identifier for
this commit (a unique identifier similar to ``12a0006''), 
your commit text, and some 
statistics about what the commit did: lines added, edited, or removed,
files added or removed, etc (\emph{see
  Figure~\ref{fig:git-example-output}}). 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \begin{framed}
    \begin{verbatim}
   > git commit
   [master 12a0006] Added first line: just says "Hello World!"
   1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
   >
   \end{verbatim}
  \end{framed}
  \caption{Example of Git's output after a commit.}
  \label{fig:git-example-output}
  % TODO: add hand-written tags to screenshot
\end{figure}

Now your project has a history! 
It looks more or less like Figure~\ref{fig:git-example-1}.
Not very impressive, but we are just starting.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/commit_history_1.eps}
  \caption{Initial history of this project}
  \label{fig:git-example-1}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{What to do when you mess up}
\label{sec:what-do-when}

Let's say we are not happy with our program. It does not do much. We
can modify the program to look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    println "Hello World!"
    println "What's your name?"
    String s = System.console().readline()
    println "Hello " + s + "!"
\end{verbatim}

Once we have saved the changes, we can commit again (\verb+git add
helloworld.groovy+; \verb+git commit+, plus a commit description). 

However, if we try to run the program, Groovy will complain. 
We have messed up! At this point, we have two options:

\begin{itemize}
\item If we know where the problem is (and in this simple example, we
  do) we can just fix it and commit again. A good commit message would
  be ``Fixed typo in line 3: readline() should be readLine()''. The
  history of the project is represented in
  Figure~\ref{fig:git-example-2}. 
\item If we did not know where the problem is, as it is usually the
  case in big programs, we can go back in time
  until we find the commit in
  which the problem started. Looking at the changes on that commit we
  can see how the \emph{bug} was introduced. Thanks to version
  control, finding bugs is much easier (and 
  finding bugs is 80\% of the job). 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/commit_history_2.eps}
  \caption{History of this project after second commit}
  \label{fig:git-example-2}
\end{figure}

The simplest way to travel in time is by looking at the change log of
a file, and we are going to see how to do that in the next section. 

\subsection{Looking into the past}
\label{sec:looking-into-past}

Contrary to most novelists, professional programmers do not usually
start working on a project from a blank editor page. 
The most common situation is to work
on a project that has already been going on for some time. Maybe the
programmer is a new employee in the company, or has been transferred
to a different project, or has ``inherited'' a project that somebody
else started. Or it may be that the programmer wants to contribute to
another project because the project is appealing or
famous\footnote{Examples of interesting free/open-source projects with
  many contributors include web browsers like Firefox or Chrome, the
  Linux kernel, the Android operating system (based on Linux), the
  LibreOffice suite of applications, mail programs 
  like Thunderbird, and many others.}. Or maybe the programmer starts a
project from scratch and then realises that somebody else is doing the
same thing, only they started long ago and have made a lot of
progress, so it makes sense to join their team instead of reinventing
the wheel. For any of these reasons ---and many others--- you will
find yourself in a situation where you want to get a copy of the
source code that other people have written. This is very easy to do in
Git. You just need to be given a URL\footnote{A Uniform
  Resource Locator (URL) is a specific character string that
  constitutes a reference to an Internet resource. Examples of URLs
  are \texttt{http://www.bbk.ac.uk} and
  \texttt{ftp://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/}.
} to the source code, and clone it. Cloning other people's project
works in the same way as cloning your own project: 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git clone https://github.com/bbk-msccs/currency-exchanger.git
\end{verbatim}

Now that we have a copy of the Currency Exchanger project, let's look
at it. You will see that it has only two files: a ``read me'' file
called \verb+README.md+ (that explains what the project is about) and
a Groovy file called \verb+currencyConverter.groovy+. This is the
interesting one. 

Look at the code of \verb+currencyConverter.groovy+ and understand
what it does and how it works. Then come back and continue reading. Go
on, I will wait for you here. 

As you can imagine, this little program was not written in one go. You
can see a summary of the history of the file by looking at its
\emph{commit log}: 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git log currencyConverter.groovy
\end{verbatim}

This will show the list of commits on your screen, ordered
chronologically. For every commit, you can see the commit ID, the
author, and the date and time on which the commit was made. You can
also read the commit message. 

You can pass arguments to \verb+git log+ so that Git only shows you
commits for one author, or between two specific dates, and many
other options. Type \verb+git help log+ for more information. You can
use \verb+git help <command>+ to get help on any other command. 

The problem with \verb+git log+ is that it does not show how the code
changed from one commit to the next. But there is a way to do this:
\verb+git diff+. Let's have a look at an example: 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git diff ab9d6 9ecf9
\end{verbatim}

This command shows the changes between those two commits. Note that I
did not have to write the whole commit ID (40 characters!) but only
the first five are fine \emph{as long as they are unique}. If the
shortened IDs you use are not unique, Git will complain. In this case,
the short IDs are unique and Git tells that only one line was changed: 

\begin{verbatim}
    index 2d97cf4..5650842 100644
    --- a/currencyConverter.groovy
    +++ b/currencyConverter.groovy
    @@ -23,7 +23,7 @@ while (!finished) {
        case 2: 
            print "How many euro would you like to convert? ";
            double euro   = Double.parseDouble(System.console().readLine());
    -       double pounds = euro * poundOverEuroRatio;
    +       double pounds = pounds * euroOverPoundRatio;
            println euro + "€ will give you £" + pounds;
            break;
         case 0:  
\end{verbatim}

The ``-'' sign on the margin shows a deleted line while the ``+'' sign
shows an added line; the other lines were not changed. 
If you take everything into account, the only thing that changed
in this commit was the name of two variables on that line. 

You can also use some special tag names for referring to a commit, as
shown on Figure

\begin{table}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{8cm}}
    ID & Identifies\ldots \\
    \hline
    9ecf9 & \ldots any commit as long as the string is unique \\
    HEAD & \ldots the latest commit done \\
    ^ & \ldots this suffix identifies the commit before another one \\ 
    HEAD^ & the commit before the latest \ldots \\
    9ecf9^^ & \ldots the commit before the commit before \emph{9ecf9} \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Commit names in Git}
  \label{tab:tagnames}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sharing is caring}
\label{sec:sharing-caring}

\subsubsection{Push}
\label{sec:push}

If you wanted to improve this program, you could edit it yourself, add
new features, change some code, etc. You would commit regularly to
make sure you always have the history of your project up to date, so
you can see what changes you introduced over time. 

At some point you will want to make your changes public (in Git
jargon, this is called \emph{pushing your changes}), e.g. to allow
other members of your team to see what you have done. To make your
changes public, you usually need a place to put your \emph{public
repository} (as opposed to your \emph{local copy}, where you
work). You can host your public repository anywhere you want, but
GitHub is a convenient, well-known, and costless possibility. For the
purposes of this discussion, I will assume that you have an account at
GitHub, that your account name is ``ilovegit'', and that you have
created a repository in GitHub called ``my-currency-exchange''. 

% The first thing you have to do (but you only need to do this the first
% time) is telling Git where to push the changes. This is done by adding
% a remote site (with the command\ldots \verb+git remote+, surprise!):

% \begin{verbatim}
%     > git remote add origin https://github.com/sergutsan/groovyck.git
% \end{verbatim}

% There are many things on that line that need explaining. First,
% ``add'' tells git that you want to add a new remote site; you can also
% remove (``rm'') and rename (``rename'') remote sites. By default,
% \verb+git remote+ will just show a list of your remote sites (name,
% url\ldots). The word ``origin'' is just a name for the new remote site
% to be used locally; origin is a common name for the main repository
% where you push your changes. We could have used ``my-projects'', or
% ``myRemoteSite'', or any other name as long as we have not used it
% yet. Finally, the URL is where the remote site
% is. GitHub\footnote{GitHub does give you much more than just hosting
%   your repositories: issue tracker, statistics, graphs, and limited
%   social networking capabilities are some of the features you can use
%   easily from their webpage. Not bad for a free service. Another good
%   option is Google Code.} will give
% you a URL that you can copy and paste (see Figure~\ref{fig:github}).

% \begin{figure}[htbp]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/gitHubScreenshot.eps}
%   \caption{Screenshot of GitHub. You can see the name of the user
%     (``bbk-msccs''), the name of the repository
%     (``currency-exchanger''), and the URL. You can use the URL both to
%     clone the reposity and to push your changes (as long as this
%     repository is yours, i.e. you can \emph{write} on it).}
%   \label{fig:github}
% \end{figure}

% Once you have configured your remote repository or repositories,
% pushing your changes is very easy: you only need to say where to push. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git push origin 
    Username for 'https://github.com': ilovegit
    Password for 'https://ilovegit@github.com':
    To https://github.com/ilovegit/my-currency-exchange.git
    6457568..55ca3da  master -> master
\end{verbatim}

The system will ask for your username (``ilovegit'' in this example)
and your password. Then, if everything goes according to plan, 
it will inform you that it has pushed your commits. Note that 
this step could
fail for several reasons, like your network connection going down. 

\subsubsection{Pull}
\label{sec:pull}

Once you have pushed your changes, how do other people see them? How
do they take the code you have \emph{pushed} into your remote
repository and put in their local copies of the source code? As you
can imagine, they \emph{pull} it. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git pull origin master
\end{verbatim}

When you pull, you have to specify the remote repository you are
pulling from (``origin'' in this case) and the branch you are pulling
from. We will talk later about branches, but for now it suffices to
say that the default branch in most projects is called ``master'', and
sometimes it is the only one. If you are not sure which branch you are
pulling from, ``master'' is usually a good guess.

Once you pull, Git will download the changes made public at that
public repository and merge them with your local copy. At this point,
you have the latest copy of the project's source code, including those
changes that somebody else (maybe you) made in a different computer. 

At this point, you have surely noticed that Git can be used to
synchronise with other team members, each other pulling whatever
changes others have pushed so that everybody is up to date; but it can
also be used to keep up to date with yourself: you can work on
different computers (at home, at the office, on your laptop on a
plane) and you can push your changes and then pull them from the other
computers. There is no need to carry around USB sticks with folders
called ``currencyExchangev2'', ``currencyExchangev3'', or
``currencyExchangev4usethisnottheother''. Git will always have the
latest version as long as you do not forget to commit and push
timely (Figure~\ref{fig:pushpull}). 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/pushpull}
  \caption{Pushing and pulling: when Alfred pushes his changes to make
    them public, Bertha will be able to pull them and work on the last
    version of the software. If Alfred takes a plane to Paris, he will
    be able to pull the changes from Paris to get the last
    version\ldots including any changes that Bertha and other
    co-workers may have pushed while he was on the plane!}
  \label{fig:pushpull}
\end{figure}

\subsection{When should I commit?}
\label{sec:when-should-i}

As a general rule: \emph{commit early, commit often}. It is generally
a good idea to make small commits so that it is easier to go through
the history of your code and understand every step if you have to. The
cost of 
committing is almost zero so you should not be afraid of having too
many commits. There is no such thing. 

Of course, this does not mean that you commit every single character
that you write. Committing every single line is also probably too
much, unless those lines are really special (e.g.~they fix a bug). 
\emph{Do not spend more time
writing commit messages than writing code}. That said, if you have not
committed for the last half hour, either you have written a lot of
code and you should commit early (as in \emph{now}); or you are tired
or distracted, and not really programming, so maybe you should have a
break.

If you are not sure what you have changed since the last commit, 
you can use \verb+git diff+. Another ---less verbose--- possibility
is to use \verb+git status+. The latter will tell you
which files have changed since the last commit, without details of the
changes.

Additionally, you should \emph{push} your changes to your public
repository fairly often. Some people say \emph{push early, push
  often}, but it does not mean that you need to push after every
commit. Sometimes 
you cannot even push because you do not have a network connection,
although this is becoming more and more uncommon these days, where you
can connect to the internet from planes, submarines, and almost a
robot wandering around Mars\footnote{Actually, a robot in Mars cannot
  connect to the internet, at least not what we call ``the Internet'' 
  in 2012 (computers interconnected using the TCP/IP and related protocols). 
  Radio waves travel \emph{only} as fast as light-speed, and it
  takes them so long to reach the Earth that internet hosts would
  timeout before a connection could be stablished. 
  You \emph{could} connect to
  the Internet from the Moon, though, but your bandwitdh would be
  very poor compared to your home connection.}. 
As a rule of thumb, push every time you 
have finished a coding session (e.g. before turning off the computer
or standing up to grab some lunch), or as soon as possible after that.

\subsection{Back to the past\ldots}
\label{sec:branching}

If you have been reading carefully until now, you will have noticed
that we do not know yet how to \emph{move back in time}. So far we
have only learnt how to look into the past using \verb+git log+. In
order to be able to \emph{roll back} when we mess up things, we need
to do one of two things: either we can \emph{revert} changes or we can
\emph{branch} the history of our source code
(Section~\ref{sec:branch-branch-everyw}).

\subsubsection{Time reversal}
\label{sec:time-reversal}

The simplest form of time reversal is by using the command 
\verb+git revert+. This command makes a commit 
that cancels all the commits that
you specify. Confusing? 

Maybe, but think that the typical use case is cancelling just the last
commit: you make some changes, you commit them, and then you realise
that you forgot to do something before committing\ldots maybe you
forgot to add a file, or something of the sort. At this point, you can
follow two courses of action. Either you do the things you had
forgotten and then commit them (using a message like ``this is what I
forgot to do in commit 25cec5a... 4''), which is not optimal; or you
revert and then commit again, like in this example.

\begin{verbatim}
    (modify file1 and file2)
    > git add file1
    > git commit 
    (realise you forgot to add file2)
    > git revert HEAD
    > git add file2
    > git commit
\end{verbatim}

HEAD is a special tag that means\footnote{Strictly speaking, it means
  the last commit \emph{for the current branch}, but for now we are
  assuming we only have one branch, called \emph{master}.} ``the last
commit''. Git will ask you 
to introduce a commit message to explain why you are reverting that
change. You are not limited to revert the last commit. You can revert
many commits, as in this example that reverts the last four commits
(you will need to add a message for each reverting commit): 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git revert HEAD HEAD^ HEAD^^ HEAD^^^
\end{verbatim}

Git will take care of all the changes to the source code for you. 

\subsubsection{Conflicts}
\label{sec:conflicts}

You can also revert any combination of commits that you want. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git revert a827e5fe 067cac919 938f6821a
\end{verbatim}

Usually, Git will do all the necessary changes to revert all those
commits and give the resulting files. 
However, reverting arbitrary commits
 may result in a conflict. A conflict happens when Git
cannot reliably make a change in the code to accommodate your
wishes. This is uncommon, but may happen if you are not careful when
reverting changes or merge two very different pieces of code. 

When a conflict happens, Git will tell you which files have conflicts
so that you can fix the source files yourself. A file with a conflict
looks like this: 

\begin{verbatim}
    (some source code here)
    <<<<<<< comit-ID-1
    (source code as in ID-1
    =======
    (source code as in ID-2
    >>>>>>> commit-ID-2
    (more source code here)
\end{verbatim}

Your role as programmer gifted with a human intelligence ---Git is
able to solve most conflicts itself, but not all--- is to decide
which code should stay: the code between \verb+<<<<+ and \verb+=====+
or the code between \verb+====+ and \verb+>>>>+. Maybe none is
correct and you need to write new code to fix the conflict (and remove
the \verb+<+, \verb+=+, and \verb+>+ symbols, of course). 

In any case, once the conflict is resolved, you have to commit the
changes. 


\subsection{Branches, branches everywhere\ldots}
\label{sec:branch-branch-everyw}

Last, but definitely not least, we need to learn about branches. You
have already met the most important one, called \emph{master}. This is
the default branch in any Git repository, and sometimes it is the only
one. But a Git repository can have an unlimited number of branches,
and this is very common for large projects. 

Branches are important in Git, and in any version control
system. Branches allow programmers to advance development without
compromising the stability of the code released to clients, to try
experimental features that may or may not be worth been added to the
project, and to collaborate with external programmers that want to
help in the development. 

There are many interesting things that you can do with branches, and
this is one of the most important features of Git. However, for the
moment we are going to see just the basic functionality. 

You create a new branch with the command 
\verb+git branch <branch_name>+, and change branches with the command
\verb+git checkout <branch_name>+. Whatever you commit to a branch is
only visible to that branch, at least until you merge it with another
branch. 

Let's see what branches are about with a small step-by-step example: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new empty Git repository. Clone it.
\item Create a new file called \verb+mainFile+ inside 
  the local copy of the repository, and then make some
  simple changes to it (e.g. add a few lines of text). 
  Commit your changes (to \emph{master}). 
\item Create a new branch: \verb+git branch testing+. Change to the
  new branch: \verb+git checkout testing+.
\item You are now in \verb+testing+. Create a new file
  \verb+experimentalFile+ and add some lines to it. Commit. 
  Add some lines
  to \verb+mainFile+ too. Commit.
\item See the history of your files using \verb+git log+.
\item Go back to the \emph{master} branch: 
  \verb+git checkout master+. 
\item See the history of your files using \verb+git log+. Do you see
  any difference?
\item Add some lines (different from before) to
  \verb+mainFile+. Commit.
\item Change branches again: \verb+git checkout testing+. Read the
  content of mainFile. Check the history: \verb+git log mainFile+. Is
  it the same history as in the other branch?
\end{enumerate}

As you can see, opening branches allows you to do experimental or
not-well-tested code without compromising your main line of
development (see Figure~\ref{fig:git-example-3}). 
After branches diverge, any new commits you make in \verb+testing+ are not
visible in \verb+master+ and viceversa. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/commit_history_3.eps}
  \caption{Project with two branches: master and experimental}
  \label{fig:git-example-3}
\end{figure}

If at a later point you become convinced that your work
in testing is worth being merged into the main branch, you can do so
with:

\begin{verbatim}
    > git checkout master
    > git merge testing
\end{verbatim}

This will merge both branches and create a new commit in \emph{master}
that includes all the changes from \emph{testing}. Note that,
depending on the changes you have made in both branches since they
separated, a conflict may arise and you will need to 
fix it (and then commit) manually (see Section~\ref{sec:conflicts}).

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/commit_history_4.eps}
  \caption{Merging branch ``experimental'' into ``master''}
  \label{fig:git-example-4}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Replacing a branch}
\label{sec:exercise-1ff}

You can also use branches to go back in time and change the way you
are doing things. For instance, think of a situation where your work
in \emph{master} was based on one technology and, further down the
line, you discover another technology that is much better. Another
possibility is that you messed up but do not realise until several
commits laters. 

You could of course just delete the code of the old technology and
start writing your new code for the new technology. But there is a
better way. You can move back in time, branch, and then continue your
development in the new branch\ldots and call it \emph{master}. The
process would be as follows: 

\begin{verbatim}
    > git checkout 33gfg32    [1]
    > git branch newMaster    [2]
    > git branch -m oldTech   [3]
    > git branch newMaster    
    > git branch -b master    [4]
\end{verbatim}

The first command [1] puts you at the right point where you want to
start a new branch. Note that you can use \verb+git checkout+ to
change branches or to change to a specific commit\footnote{Actually,
  branches in Git are implemented as aliases of commits, so it is
  basically the same thing. In other words, a branch is just a pointer
  that points to a commit and that gets updated every time there is a
  commit and that branch is active.}. Then you create a new branch [2]
as we have seen before. Then you change the name of the current
branch [3], using \verb+git branch -b+ (look up the help for more
details). Finally, you change branches and rename the new branch to
\emph{master} [4]. Then you continue your development in the new
branch. 

There is much more that can be said about branches and how they make
it easy to have several levels of development in your projects, and
how they make it easy for many programmers to work on the same
project, but we will see all of that at a later point. 

\subsection{Ignoring files}
\label{sec:ignoring-files}

Sometimes you want Git to ignore some files. You do not want to keep
them under version control, cannot delete them, and do not want to
have them appearing on the screen every time that you check the status
of the repository. This is a common occurrence for temporary files
like \verb+.o+ files in C/C++, \verb+.class+ files in Java,
\verb+.dvi+ files in \LaTeX, automatic backup files, etc.

The way to tell Git to ignore these files is by listing them in a file
called \verb+.gitignore+ at the root of the repository. This file can
contain name files, but can also include wildcards. The typical
content of a \verb+.gitignore+ file can look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    *.o
    *.class
    *~
\end{verbatim}

You can add comments to a \verb+.gitignore+ file (with ``\#''), add
exceptions to wildcard rules (with ``!''), and many more useful
tricks. Remember, \verb+git help gitignore+ is a good place to start
looking for help. 

The file \verb+.gitignore+ can (and should) be added and 
committed to your repository like any other file.
