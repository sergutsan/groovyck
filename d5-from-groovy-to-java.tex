\section{Introducing Java}
\label{sec:introducing-java}

The time has come to start using full-flavoured Java. This section
will introduce the main features that are new with respect to what we
have seen so far. We will make a gradual transition to the new
language. 

\subsection{Everything is a class}
\label{sec:everything-class}

In Java all the code comes inside a class. There is no class-less
code as in Groovy or Java Decaf.

Usually every class is defined in its own file, e.g.~a \verb+Person+
class is defined in a file called \verb+Person.java+. When a file
contains only one class, this class must be \verb+public+ and have the same
name as the file (without the \verb+.java+ extension). 

Classes in different files must be compiled independently before they
can be used. This is another important difference with the Groovy or
Java Decaf
scripts we have been using until now, where every script was
self-contained. From now on we will have classes in different files,
and unless we compile\footnote{If you do not remember clearly what
  \emph{compiling} means, read again the notes from day 1. } them and
transform those text files into something that can be understood by
the machine, the machine will not find the classes you are
calling. Java classes (i.e.~files) are compiled with the java
compiler, \verb+javac+. 

\begin{verbatim}
    > javac Person.java
\end{verbatim}

This will produce a file \verb+Person.class+ in your folder. Once you
have it, you can use the Person class from any other file (e.g.~your
Groovy or Java Decaf scripts). 

\paragraph{Classpath. }
\label{sec:classpath.-}

You may be wondering how is it possible to use classes like String
that are not in your current directory in the form of a \verb+.class+
file. This is because Java comes with a lot of classes built-in,
including String. These classes are in your CLASSPATH, which is a list
of locations in your computer\footnote{A CLASSPATH is something
  conceptually similar to a PATH (a list of locations in your computer
  where the operating system looks for executable files when you type
  them in the command line, see exercises from Day 2). 
  Both are environment variables, and can be
  accessed and modified in the same way.} where Java looks for the
classes you are using in your program. We will see more about this in
the future.

\subsection{The Java Library}
\label{sec:java-api}

Java is not just a programming language (a set of keywords and
syntactic rules). It also provides a broad library of classes that
you can use in your program. You know some of them already, like
String or the boxed types (Integer, Double, etc). 

This library is available for any Java programmer for free. There are
literally thousands of useful classes in the library, and they are
well documented in one website, coloquially referred to as ``the
JavaDoc'' or ``the Java API''. You can find it very easily by using
your favourite search
engine to look up ``java API'' (Figure~\ref{fig:ajavadoc}). API stands
for Application Programmer's Interface. 

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/javadoc}
  \caption{The Java API main page}
  \label{fig:ajavadoc}
\end{figure}

You can see that there are three frames: top-left, a list of packages
(we will learn what packages are at a later point); bottom-left, a
list of classes; right, the main frame. You can find a lot of
information about all classes in the Java Library on this website. You
can also get a local copy on your hard disk if you plan to work
without an internet connection. 

Look up any class (e.g.~String) in the list of classes at the
bottom-left. Click on it. Read the documentation on the main
frame. Every page in Java Doc follows the same structure: 

\begin{description}
\item[General description:] at the beginning.
\item[List of fields:] all visible fields of the class, if any.
\item[List of constructor methods:] each of them with a brief
  description, a list of parameters and other useful information, and
  a link to a more detailed description.
\item[List of methods:] each of them with a brief
  description, a list of parameters and other useful information, and
  a link to a more detailed description.
\item[Detailed description of methods:] additional details, use cases,
  etc. 
\end{description}

You must become familiar with the Java Doc. You will use it very often
as a Java programmer. 

\subsection{System.out.println()}
\label{sec:system.out.println}

As we have said, everything is an object in Java. One consequence of
this is
that Groovy's and Java Decaf's \verb+println()+
that we have been using are no 
longer available. Instead, we can use its full object-oriented
version: 

\begin{verbatim}
    System.out.println("Hello (Java-)World!");
\end{verbatim}

Note that \verb+println+ is just a normal method, called from an
object with dot-notation and with a list of parameters: \verb+out+ is
a static object in class \verb+System+, and method \verb+println+ is a
method of that object.
Up to now, Groovy and Java Decaf were adding all the additional elements to make our
lifes easier; but we must do it ourselves in the (full) Java world. 

\subsection{Semicolons are compulsory}
\label{sec:semic-are-comp}

In Java, the semicolons at the end of a statement are compulsory, not
optional, and they mark the end of a statement. 
The advantage of this is that statements can go over several lines. 

\begin{verbatim}
    System.out.println("This is a long text that does not fit " + 
                       "in one line, but that is no problem.");
\end{verbatim}

The downside is that if you forget to add a semicolon at the end of
the line, 
Java will get confused and complain. 


\subsubsection{Casting: conversion of simple types}
\label{sec:cast-conv-simple}

As you already know, Groovy is a dynamically-typed language, which
means that a variable can change its type during the execution of the
program (i.e.~the box can change its \emph{type} tag). 

Java, on the other hand, is a statically-typed language. Once a
variable is created, Java will not change its type. If you try to
assign it a value of a different type it will complain.

However, there are times in which you have an \verb+int+ but want to
transform it into a \verb+double+ to perform division, or some other
similar situation. This what \emph{casting} is for. When you cast a
variable you change its type, as in the following example: 

\begin{verbatim}
    int i = 1;
    double d = (double) i;
\end{verbatim}

This code will take the value of \verb+i+, which is 1, and transform
it into a double (\verb+1.0+) before assigning it to the
variable \verb+d+. 

Note that not all castings can be done transparently. If you cast a
\verb+double+ into an \verb+int+, for example, you will lose the
decimal part because there is no decimal part in an \verb+int+. 

\paragraph{Casting for complex types?}
\label{sec:cast-compl-types}

There is also a version of casting for complex types, but it is more
complicated and is related to type hierarchies. We will see how it
works when the time is due.

\subsection{Strings and chars}
\label{sec:strings-chars}

In Groovy, you could use either single quotes or double quotes to mark
a String. In Java you can only use the latter. Single quotes are used
to mark values of type \verb+char+. 

\begin{verbatim}
    // a one-character String in Groovy, 1 char in Java
    char c = 'a';               

    // a String in both languages
    String str = "This is a string";

    // the following is valid in Groovy, but invalid in Java
    String str2 = 'Another string';  
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{A new complex type: Arrays}
\label{sec:arrays}

A String can be seen as a series of characters one after the
other. This simple idea can be extended to series of other simple
types: not just chars, but also integers and doubles. In Java, 
this is called an \emph{array}. 

Arrays are a way of having several elements of data of the same type;
for example, a company could have a payroll program that used an array with
the IDs of all its employees (an array of integers). 
Arrays can be of simple but also complex types; therefore, the
aforementioned program could also have array of Strings to store the
names of the employees. 

An array is declared using \emph{square} brackets. Square brackets are also
used to access the elements in the array. Let's see an 
example\footnote{Remember that this is Java code, not Groovy code, so
  it must be \emph{in} a method \emph{in} a class; it cannot be in a
  program or script of its own. We do not show the class and the
  method here for the sake of space.} using an
array of Strings: 

\begin{verbatim}
    String[] employeeArray;
    employeeArray = new String[5];
    employeeArray[0] = "Alice";
    employeeArray[1] = "Bob";
    employeeArray[2] = "Charlie";
    employeeArray[3] = "Dave";
    employeeArray[4] = "Eve";
    System.out.println("Our first employee is " + employeeArray[0]);
    System.out.println("Our company has " + employeeArray.length + " employees");
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, sometimes you need a number inside the brackets and
sometimes you do not: 

\begin{itemize}
\item You do not need a number to declare the array, i.e.~to tell the
  computer that you want to have an array (of Strings, in this
  case). As all declarations, this reserves a box of type ``array of
  Strings, String[]'' and name \verb+employeeArray+.
\item In the next line, we reserve a portion of memory to store the
  actual Strings, and of course we have to specify the length;
  otherwise \verb+new+ will not know how much memory to allocate. Note
  that arrays are an exception and do \emph{not} have a normal
  constructor method, even if they are created with \verb+new+ (in
  other words, there are no round brackets, but square brackets; this
  only happens in Java with arrays). 
\item Finally, when we want to access an element in an array, either
  for reading or for writing/replacing, we also have to specify
  \emph{which} element we want to access.
\end{itemize}

All arrays in Java have an integer field called \verb+length+ that is equal to
the size of the array. This value never changes. When an array is
created (using \verb+new+) its size is determined once and for all. 

\subsubsection*{At midnight, it is the zeroth hour\ldots}
\label{sec:at-midnight-it}

It is very important to remember that the first element of an array is
at position $zero$. The last element, accordingly, is at position 
$length - 1$. 

You may remember that the first character of a String was also at
position zero. As a matter of fact, Strings are implemented internally
as arrays of \verb+char+. 

If you try to access an element of an array (or a String) that is at
position $length$ or beyond, or on a negative position, you will get
an \verb+IndexOutOfBoundsException+. A common error is trying to
access the last element in the array using
\verb+myArray[myArray.length]+ instead 
of \verb+myArray[myArray.length - 1]+.

\subsubsection*{Curly-bracket initialisation of arrays}
\label{sec:curly-brack-init}

Initialising an array element-by-element is boring and takes a lot of
space. There is a special notation using curly brackets that allows
programmers to initialise an array in one line: 

\begin{verbatim}
    int[] employeeIdArray = {123, 55, 14, 642, 243};
\end{verbatim}

If you write something like this, Java will automatically calculate
the size of the array for you and will allocate memory for it and
point to it. 

\subsubsection*{2-D, 3-D, and beyond\ldots}
\label{sec:2d-3d-beyondldots}

You can also have arrays of arrays, in which case they are usually
called matrices: 2-D matrices, 3-D matrices, etc. Let's see a 2-D
example: 

\begin{verbatim}
    int[][] matrix;
    matrix = new int[3][3];
    matrix[0][0] = 1;
    matrix[0][1] = 2;
    matrix[0][2] = 3;
    matrix[1][0] = 4;
    matrix[1][1] = 5;
    matrix[1][2] = 6;
    matrix[2][0] = 7;
    matrix[2][1] = 8;
    matrix[2][2] = 9;
\end{verbatim}

As you can see, a multi-dimensional array is just an array of
arrays. It is initialised in the same way as any other array, and its
elements are accessed in the same way as with a 1-D array, only using
more indexes. You can also use curly-bracket notation to initialise an
array in a more compact way: 

\begin{verbatim}
    int[][] matrix3 =  {{1,2,3},{3,4,5},{6,7,8}};
\end{verbatim}

And it is not uncommon to write this in different lines to improve
clarity. Remember that in Java semicolons are compulsory, so
statements do not really finish at the end of the line; they continue
from line to line until a semicolon is reached. 

\begin{verbatim}
    int[][] matrix3 =  { { 1, 2, 3},
                         { 3, 4, 5},
                         { 6, 7, 8} };
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Exercise}
\label{sec:exercisejfjfj}

Write a small program that asks for the names and IDs of all employees
in a small company, and store them in an array of integers and an
array of Strings. The company has 10 employees.

Use a loop to go through both arrays and print the names and IDs of
those employees whose ID is less than 1000. Use another loop to print
the names and IDs of those employees whose name starts with ``J''
or~``S''.
