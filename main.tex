\textbf{Important note: } If anything is unclear, or you have any 
sort of problem (e.g.,
downloading or installing Groovy on your computer), please send an
email to Sergio Gutierrez-Santos (\emph{sergut@dcs.bbk.ac.uk}).

\textbf{Acknowledgements: } I am in great debt with 
Keith Mannock for his invaluable help in the initial stages of
preparing this document, and also with Roger Mitton for his C++ notes
(based on work by S.P. Connolly) that influenced its genesis. 
Thanks to all reviewers that have helped to 
find typos, errors, and omisions. Although they are too numerous to
name them all, I could not go without mentioning Alexandra
Poulovassilis for her \emph{beyond the call of duty} efforts clean
these notes free of numerical, syntactical, and typographical
\emph{bugs}. Any errors that you, my dear reader, may still find are
only my own fault.

% MAJOR REORGANISATION FOR NEXT YEAR:
% 
% Goals: 
%   - Trevor constraint: PT must see trees before D11 has ended
%   - Corolary to the Trevor constraint: PT should go to Xmas 
%       knowing how to use the Java Collections Library 
%   - Recursion constraint: recursion should be understood before 
%       trees are presented
%   - only solution: FT and PT follow different schedules
%   - In PC++ the difficulty is pointers and recursion; in PiJ the 
%       difficulty is pointers and multi-threading (recursion falls
%       down to level 2 of difficulty)
%
% FT:  
%   D1: refresh
%   D2: Git
%   D3: simple / complex types
%   D4: methods
%   D5: arrays, access levels, reading javadoc, differences groovy/java
%   D6: recursion 1
%   D7: recursion 2
%   D8: pointers, lists
%   D9: static, interfaces, stacks, queues, 
%   D10: trees,
%   D11: testing, introducing annotations
%   D12: TDD, final, more annotations, write javadoc
%   D13: inheritance
%   D14: polymorphism (and the collections library)
%   D15: Exception handling
%   D16: I/O
%   D17: concurrency 1: basics: Thread, Runnable, synchronized
%   D18: concurrency 2: java.concurrent and fork/join
%   D19: concurrency 3: CSP?
%   D20: network 1: RPC
%   D21: network 2: REST
%   D22: work in the lab: only one day... for revision

% PT:  
%   D1: refresh
%   D2: Git
%   D3: simple / complex types

%   D5: arrays, access levels, reading javadoc, differences groovy/java
%   D6: recursion all in one day (but it IS a full week)
%   D7: pointers, lists
%   D8: static, interfaces, stacks, queues, 
%   D9: trees (and what are arrays for: main method, varargs)
%   D10: inheritance
%   D11: polymorphism (and the collections library)
%   ------- Xmas ---------
%   D12: testing, introducing annotations

%   D21: work in the lab: a full fortnight for revision
%   D22: work in the lab: a full fortnight for revision


% Day 0: what do I want from you?
%   - to be self-sufficient learners
%   - to be creative
%   - to be able to read code
%   - to be able to write code (is this the same as being "creative")

% Day 1: welcome to CS!  (assumption: they read the notes already!)
% \item Basics: variables, types, initialization, comments
% \item Flow control: branches, loops
%    add switch/case and ternary operator
%    leave for loops for lists
%    leave do/while for Java, because there is not in Groovy
% Day 2: 
% \item Source code version control
% and lots of exercises, because there is nothing else to tell...
\chapter{Week 1: Here it all begins\ldots}
\input{section1-Intro,basicIO,variables}
\input{section2-Variables,integers,strings,comments}
\input{section3-If,else}
\input{section4-Booleans,while}
\input{section5-doWhile,switch,ternary}

% Week 2: getting up to speed, but not quite
% Day 3: 
% \item Simple and complex data types: primitive types (introducing
%    float and double), strings, 
%    classes without methods... use of "new" and "null"
% \item Let them create structs and modify them
%   - CHANGE: instead of levels of access, basics of regular
%       expressions!  -> and String.split()
%
% Day 4:
% \item For loops? -> already covered... where should this be in the
%       book? 
% \item Maybe?? They have seen classes -> levels of access
%       No, leave for D5
% \item Functions/Procedures/Methods, parameters (look at week 4
%   in C++) 
%   \item talk about side effects -> procedures
%   \item including a bit on already know methods like substring()
%       Update: Not needed, except as an example
%   \item scope: variables inside the methods are copied... but 
%     beware of what happens with complex types! Many exercises
%     about this!
%       Update: 
% \item Optional? Basics of regular expressions -> Update: no! Too much.
%     Maybe better access levels first, regular expressions later
%     Definitely!
%     Update: they are having trouble with moving pointers and copying
%     pointers around. Better leave regular expressions for the
%     future.
\chapter{Week 2: Moving on\ldots}
\input{w2-simpleAndComplexDataTypes}
\input{w2-methods}

% Day 5: From Groovy to Java (only 1 day)
% \item More on classes and objects: initialization and
% constructors (what "new" really does), 
%      - PLUS access levels
%        \item Information hiding
%        - Levels of access in Java
%          - All variables private unless good reason
%          - Methods public or private depending on target public
%
%   NOTE: no main method, no real java today: continue working from Groovy
%   script ---> BUT YOU NEED TO COMPILE THE CLASSES with javac!
%      - explain some basic classes and their main methods, like String
%      (equals, substring(*), length (*), intValue, doubleValue),
%      Integer (parseInt), Math, System
%      - introduce them to (reading) JavaDocs: constructors, methods, deprecated
%      - make them do exercises with their own classes: create them, 
%        make objects, use them
%   - casting of simple types
%   - chars with 'c', Strings with "c"
%   - arrays and multi-dimensional arrays, 
%   exercise: enter a matrix and say if it is simmetrical
%   exercise: hundir la flota
%             y luego hundir la flota pintando en la pantalla
%   - Update: sometimes Groovy cannot use Java classes. Investigate. TODO
% 
% ASSIGNMENT: class Library (and class Book, and class User): enter
%    new books, enter new Users, take books (max 3 per user), return
%    books; only three classes, and only public what needs to be
%    public (check by reflection)
\chapter{Week 3: From Groovy to Java}
\input{d5-constructors-access}
% \chapter{From Groovy to Java}
\input{d5-from-groovy-to-java}

% Day 6,7,8: Pointers!
% \item Data structures: lists, stacks, trees, maps (and iterators)\ldots
%       including exercises in creating their own structures
%       themselves -> correct them with JUnit to show them the tests
%       the week after.
% \item day 6: Real java: 
%                 the static keyword,
%                     and methods from System and Math
%                 the main method,
%                 OBSOLETE: System.out.println(); bye, bye, Groovy scripts,
%                 OBSOLETE: introduce pointers...
%                 use pointers for creating a linked list (a 
%                     growing/decreasing array, using a Node 
%                     class that contains data and points to another
%                     Node) 
%                 do..while
%                 sorting algorithms (for exercises)
\input{d6-static,main,doWhile,lists}
\chapter{Week 4: Pointers everywhere!}
% \item day 7: More on data structures: 
%              interfaces: Stack, Queue, 
%              queues and stacks, 
%              // sets - removed because it requires overriding of equals
%              maps,
%              basics of memory allocation, gargage collection, 
\input{d7-queue-stack-trees-interface}
% \item day 8: More on data structures: 
%         OPTIONAL? iterators (interace Iterable, interface Iterator)
%             -> for-each loops --> star exercise
%         trees, binary and non-binary trees, 
%         OPTIONAL (creating) JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale 
%         OPTIONAL/TOO MUCH/NEXT YEAR: memory leaks (profiling?) -->
%                     ---> too much, leave as "extra" material
%    \item ASSIGNMENT: read XML (I provide the class) and re-create the tree
%    structure up to a point THIS IS NOT WELL DEFINED!
%
%   at the beginning, introduce real Java: needed for Testing with
%      Junit4 anyway
%      a) main method (optional)
%      b) class structure
%      c) no more println -> System.out.println()
%      d) no more String comparisons with "==" -> make an exercise
%        or an example about it
\input{d8-trees}

\chapter{Testing}
% Day 9,10: Testing (...whether they have learnt anything yet)
% Day 9:
% \item Software testing 
%       Show them the tests that test 
%         whether their versions work the
%         same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item NEXT YEAR: overloading of methods -> assertEquals()
% 
% IMPORTANT: HOW DO YOU RUN TESTS WITHOUT ECLIPSE (from cmd)!!
%    Easy: compile: javac -cp /.../junit.jar TestClass.java
%          run:     java  -cp
%          /.../junit.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass
% 
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
\input{d9-testing}
% 
% Day 10:
% \item final
% \item Test-driven development
%       Show them the tests that test whether their versions work the
%       same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
% \item Annotations to cover:
%     @Test
%       timeout = 15000
%       expected = IllegalStateException.class
%     @Before, @BeforeClass
%     @After, @AfterClass
% \item JavaDoc: do you want your classes to look like the
%      proffesional ones? Use Javadoc!!
% \item Do not confuse annotations with JavaDoc!! @throws, etc
% \item final
% \item Introduction to the Java Collections library
%
% ASSIGNMENT: produce a test specification for some program, and then
% create the program... maybe better give them the interface and then
% they must implement the battery of tests... mmm... difficult to
% test, isn't it? How do you test tests? On the other hand, this is
% important stuff so they should be examined on it...
% 
% FOR NEXT YEAR: refactor TDD into D9, and leave D10 with little extra
%     material (or no extra material whatsoever, apart from the
%     collection library and JavaDoc?)
\input{d10-tdd}

% Day 11,12: Padding week to recover their breath
% \item Introduction to generics in Java
%    Make your own List<T> (and Node<T>), Stack<T> and Queue<T>
%    (probably extending List<T>), and Map<K,V>
% \item Introduction to the Java Collections library
% \item More on object orientation: inheritance (and type
%   hierarchies, upcasting/downcasting of complex types),
%   polymorphism, overloading, overriding, "static" (good "real"
%   example: implementation of 
%   read-only versions of collections), interfaces (like Iterable, 
%   Runnable, or the ones in the Collections)... and why interfaces
%   are important. 
% \item the keyword super, and its role in constructor methods:
%     "hidden" super()
% \item the final keyword for methods and classes
% \item more on .equals(), .hashcode(), etc
% \item Annotation @Override
% Day 11: 
%    - extends
%      - top-down inheritance: interfaces + code = abstract classes
%        - explain that abstract classes are "extended" and have
%          "abstract" methods
%      - bottom-up inheritance: abstract/non-abstract classes
%      - extension of already existing classes
%         - final for methods and classes
%      - everything is Object
%    - overriding / overwriting
%      - annotation @Override
%      - equals(), hashcode()
%    - super
%      - "hidden" super()
%    \item composition better than extension
\input{d11-inheritance} 
% Day 12: 
%    - Polymorphyism: 
%        - generics
%        - overloading of methods
%        - upcasting / downcasting
\input{d12-polymorphism}
%
% \item Exercise Make a class that extends String and overwrites
%     toString() to call super.super.toString(), and then pass it to a
%     println(). 
% \item Maybe a sample test, like Roger Mitton does?(remember you
%   have a spare week (it's 11 not 10, count them JIC))... better next
%   week, so I can test up to here; plus recursion week seems a bit
%   empty.
% \item Maybe some project for groups?? -> leave for OODP
%
% ASSIGNMENT: something that uses inheritance and
%   polymorphism... great idea, now what?

% Day 13,14: Recursion!
% TODO: next year, introduce recursion before pointers? or better to
%     do it with full Java? Mmmm... given that recursion cannot be
%     graded with JUnit, it does not matter; therefore, probably
%     better to introduce it earlier, so that it can be used to work
%     with lists. -> Make sure you cover maps and trees before Xmas
%     with the part-timers (the Fenner constraint)!
%     UPDATE: early recursion means that PT go to Xmas with no
%     knowledge of generics or the Collections Library. Better to
%     leave recursion for later and remove all things recursive from
%     early days. 
%     UPDATE: major reorganisation. See above. 
% \item Recursion
% \item The execution stack (they will see it next week, if they have
%     not yet)
% \item Remember they have already seen recursion: add and delete in
%       linked lists
% \item Exercise: merge sort, quicksort (if seen after lists)
\input{d13-recursion}
\input{d14-more-recursion}

% Day 15,16: Exceptions and (finally) I/O (files, mostly)
% \item Exception Handling
%   plus checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and 
%        *never* do "catch (Exception e) {}"!
%   plus the 3 Abrahams guarantees
\input{d15-exception-handling}
% \item I/O in Java
% \item ASSIGNMENT: something that reads a CSV with rains in different
%    regions and returns a file that says who had more rains, what was
%    the average, etc
\input{d16-io}

% Day 17,18: Concurrency
% Day 17:
% \item Concurrent programming
%       Thread, Runnable
%       Atomicity
%       synchronized: class and object locks 
% Day 18:
% \item package java.concurrency


% Day 19,20: Network programming (which means more I/O)
% \item OBSOLETE: Network programming: TCP, UDP
% \item Web services
% \item ASSIGNMENT: chat program

% Day 21, 22
% 
% Small mini-lecture on: how are things going to get better?
%     - No more creating your own data-structures: Java Collections Library
%     - No more modifying the classpath for JUnit -> Eclipse does it
%     - No more command-line Git (at least, not all the time)
%     - No more debugging-by-println: use the debugger
%     - Automatic indentation (and re-indentation)
%
%  - Think of a good exercise. If I take it, I will give you 5%. 



% Optional material for Day 20,21
% - Swing?
% - Reflection?
% - Regular expressions?
% - Basics of the JVM vs. other compiled languages
% - Composition over extension
% - JAR files: how to create one, how to use it from the cmd line
% - More Annotations: 
%     @SuppressWarnings
%     @Deprecated
% - Garbage collection, memory leaks, profiling... is this Tools'
%   material?
% - More of data structures: hash tables?
%  Optional (from D10):
%    Notes on optimization (use Kernigahn & Pike): 
%    - Early optimization: wrong
%    - Profiling to find *what* to optimise
%    - Techniques: 
%      - Cache or pre-computed results
%          Exercise: command-line montecarlo simulator: parse
%              expressions and execute, with and without cache
