\textbf{Important note: } If anything is unclear, or you have any 
sort of problem (e.g.,
downloading or installing Groovy on your computer), please send an
email to Sergio Gutierrez-Santos (\emph{sergut@dcs.bbk.ac.uk}).

\textbf{Acknowledgements: } I am in great debt with 
Keith Mannock for his invaluable help in the initial stages of
preparing this document, and also with Roger Mitton for his C++ notes
(based on work by S.P. Connolly) that influenced its genesis. 
Thanks to all reviewers that have helped to 
find typos, errors, and omisions. Although they are too numerous to
name them all, I could not go without mentioning Alexandra
Poulovassilis for her \emph{beyond the call of duty} efforts clean
these notes free of numerical, syntactical, and typographical
\emph{bugs}. Any errors that you, my dear reader, may still find are
only my own fault.

% Day 0: what do I want from you?
%   - to be self-sufficient learners
%   - to be able to read code
%   - to be able to write code

% Day 1: welcome to CS!  (assumption: they read the notes already!)
% \item Basics: variables, types, initialization, comments
% \item Flow control: branches, loops
%    add switch/case and ternary operator
%    leave for loops for lists
%    leave do/while for Java, because there is not in Groovy
% Day 2: 
% \item Source code version control
% and lots of exercises, because there is nothing else to tell...
\chapter{Week 1: Here it all begins\ldots}
\input{section1-Intro,basicIO,variables}
\input{section2-Variables,integers,strings,comments}
\input{section3-If,else}
\input{section4-Booleans,while}
\input{section5-doWhile,switch,ternary}

% Week 2: getting up to speed, but not quite
% Day 3: 
% \item Simple and complex data types: primitive types (introducing
%    float and double), strings, 
%    classes without methods... use of "new" and "null"
% \item Let them create structs and modify them
%   - CHANGE: instead of levels of access, basics of regular
%       expressions!  -> and String.split()
%
% Day 4:
% \item For loops? -> already covered... where should this be in the
%       book? 
% \item Maybe?? They have seen classes -> levels of access
%       No, leave for D5
% \item Functions/Procedures/Methods, parameters (look at week 4
%   in C++) 
%   \item talk about side effects -> procedures
%   \item including a bit on already know methods like substring()
%       Update: Not needed, except as an example
%   \item scope: variables inside the methods are copied... but 
%     beware of what happens with complex types! Many exercises
%     about this!
%       Update: 
% \item Optional? Basics of regular expressions -> Update: no! Too much.
%     Maybe better access levels first, regular expressions later
%     Definitely!
%     Update: they are having trouble with moving pointers and copying
%     pointers around. Better leave regular expressions for the
%     future.
\chapter{Week 2: Moving on\ldots}
\input{w2-simpleAndComplexDataTypes}
\input{w2-methods}

% Day 5: From Groovy to Java (only 1 day)
% \item More on classes and objects: initialization and
% constructors (what "new" really does), 
%      - PLUS access levels
%        \item Information hiding
%        - Levels of access in Java
%          - All variables private unless good reason
%          - Methods public or private depending on target public
%
%   NOTE: no main method, no real java today: continue working from Groovy
%   script ---> BUT YOU NEED TO COMPILE THE CLASSES with javac!
%      - explain some basic classes and their main methods, like String
%      (equals, substring(*), length (*), intValue, doubleValue),
%      Integer (parseInt), Math, System
%      - introduce them to (reading) JavaDocs: constructors, methods, deprecated
%      - make them do exercises with their own classes: create them, 
%        make objects, use them
%   - casting of simple types
%   - chars with 'c', Strings with "c"
%   - arrays and multi-dimensional arrays, 
%   exercise: enter a matrix and say if it is simmetrical
%   exercise: hundir la flota
%             y luego hundir la flota pintando en la pantalla
%   - Update: sometimes Groovy cannot use Java classes. Investigate. TODO
% 
% ASSIGNMENT: class Library (and class Book, and class User): enter
%    new books, enter new Users, take books (max 3 per user), return
%    books; only three classes, and only public what needs to be
%    public (check by reflection)
\chapter{Week 3: From Groovy to Java}
\input{d5-constructors-access}
% \chapter{From Groovy to Java}
\input{d5-from-groovy-to-java}

% Day 6,7,8: Pointers!
% \item Data structures: lists, stacks, trees, maps (and iterators)\ldots
%       including exercises in creating their own structures
%       themselves -> correct them with JUnit to show them the tests
%       the week after.
% \item day 6: Real java: 
%                 the static keyword,
%                     and methods from System and Math
%                 the main method,
%                 OBSOLETE: System.out.println(); bye, bye, Groovy scripts,
%                 OBSOLETE: introduce pointers...
%                 use pointers for creating a linked list (a 
%                     growing/decreasing array, using a Node 
%                     class that contains data and points to another
%                     Node) 
%                 do..while
%                 sorting algorithms (for exercises)
\input{d6-static,main,doWhile,lists}
\chapter{Week 4: Pointers everywhere!}
% \item day 7: More on data structures: 
%              interfaces: Stack, Queue, 
%              queues and stacks, 
%              trees, binary and non-binary trees, 
%              basics of memory allocation, gargage collection, 
\input{d7-queue-stack-interface-iterator-for-each}
% \item day 8: More on data structures: 
%         maps,
%         sets,
%         iterators (interace Iterable, interface Iterator)
%         for-each loops
%         OPTIONAL (creating) JavaDoc: document inputs, output, and rationale 
%         OPTIONAL/TOO MUCH/NEXT YEAR: memory leaks (profiling?)
%    \item ASSIGNMENT: read XML (I provide the class) and re-create the tree
%    structure up to a point THIS IS NOT WELL DEFINED!
%
%   at the beginning, introduce real Java: needed for Testing with
%      Junit4 anyway
%      a) main method (optional)
%      b) class structure
%      c) no more println -> System.out.println()
%      d) no more String comparisons with "==" -> make an exercise
%        or an example about it


% Day 9,10: Testing (...whether they have learnt anything yet)
% Day 9:
% \item Introduction to the Java Collections library
% \item Introduce "final"
% \item Software testing 
%       Show them the tests that test 
%         whether their versions work the
%         same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item Introduce final
% IMPORTANT: HOW DO YOU RUN TESTS WITHOUT ECLIPSE (from cmd)!!
%    Easy: compile: javac -cp /.../junit.jar TestClass.java
%          run:     java  -cp
%          /.../junit.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass
% 
% \item Ultra-brief introduction to annotations in Java
% \item Do not confuse annotations with JavaDoc!! @throws, etc
% \item Annotations to cover:
%     @Test
%       timeout = 15000
%       expected = IllegalStateException.class
%     @Before, @BeforeClass
%     @After, @AfterClass
%     @Override
%     @SuppressWarnings
%     @Deprecated
% 
% Day 10:
% \item Test-driven development
%       Show them the tests that test whether their versions work the
%       same as the versions of the Java library.
% \item JavaDoc: do you want your classes to look like the
%      proffesional ones? Use Javadoc!!
%
%  Optional (D10): ... probably move to Day 21,22
%  Notes on optimization (use Kernigahn & Pike): 
%    - Early optimization: wrong
%    - Profiling to find *what* to optimise
%    - Techniques: 
%      - Cache or pre-computed results
%          Exercise: command-line montecarlo simulator: parse
%              expressions and execute, with and without cache
%
% ASSIGNMENT: produce a test specification for some program, and then
% create the program

% Day 11,12: Padding week to recover their breath
% \item Introduction to generics in Java
%    Make your own List<T> (and Node<T>), Stack<T> and Queue<T>
%    (probably extending List<T>), and Map<K,V>
% \item More on object orientation: inheritance (and type
%   hierarchies, upcasting/downcasting of complex types),
%   polymorphism, overloading, overriding, "static" (good "real"
%   example: implementation of 
%   read-only versions of collections), interfaces (like Iterable, 
%   Runnable, or the ones in the Collections)... and why interfaces
%   are important. 
% \item the keyword super, and its role in constructor methods:
%     "hidden" super()
% \item more on .equals(), .hashcode(), etc
% \item Exercise Make a class that extends String and overwrites
%     toString() to call super.super.toString(), and then pass it to a
%     println(). 
% \item Maybe a sample test, like Roger Mitton does?(remember you
% have a spare week (it's 11 not 10, count them JIC))
% \item Maybe some project for groups??
% ASSIGNMENT: something that uses recursion and inheritance and polymorphism

% Day 13,14: Recursion!
% TODO: next year, introduce recursion before pointers? or better to
%     do it with full Java? Mmmm... given that recursion cannot be
%     graded with JUnit, it does not matter; therefore, probably
%     better to introduce it earlier, so that it can be used to work
%     with lists. -> Make sure you cover maps and trees before Xmas
%     with the part-timers (the Trevor constraint)!
% \item Recursion
% \item The execution stack (they will see it next week, if they have
%     not yet)
% \item Remember they have already seen recursion: add and delete in
%       linked lists
% \item Exercise: merge sort, quicksort (if seen after lists)

% Day 15,16: Exceptions and (finally) I/O (files, mostly)
% \item Exception Handling
%   plus checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and 
%        *never* do "catch (Exception e) {}"!
%   plus the 3 Abrahams guarantees
% \item I/O in Java
% \item ASSIGNMENT: something that reads a CSV with rains in different
%    regions and returns a file that says who had more rains, what was
%    the average, etc

% Day 17,18: Concurrency
% \item Concurrent programming

% Day 19,20: Network programming (which means more I/O)
% \item OBSOLETE: Network programming: TCP, UDP
% \item Web services
% \item ASSIGNMENT: chat program
% 

% Optional material for Day 20,21
% - Swing?
% - Reflection?
% - Regular expressions?
% - Basics of the JVM vs. other compiled languages
% - Composition over extension
% - JAR files: how to create one, how to use it from the cmd line
% - Garbage collection, memory leaks, profiling... is this Tools' material?
