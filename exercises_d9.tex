Before the next day, you should have achieved the following learning
goals: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the importance of automated testing. 
\item Write your own tests for classes already defined. 
\item Execute your own tests for classes already defined. 
\end{itemize}

You should be able to finish most of non-star exercises in the lab. 
Remember that star exercises are more difficult. 
\textbf{Do not try star-exercises unless the other ones are clear to
  you}.

\section{Practice "Find bugs once"}
\label{sec:practice-find-bugs}

The method \verb+getInitials(String)+ has a bug! If you introduce a
name with more than space between words, it throws an exception.

Create a class that contains the method \verb+getInitials(String)+ as
described in the notes. Create also the test class as described in the
notes. 

Then follow the ``find bugs once'' recipe: reproduce the bug manually,
reproduce the bug programmatically by adding a new test to the testing
class, then fix the bug and check that all tests pass.
